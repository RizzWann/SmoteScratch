# Problem
Use SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for digits 3 and 5 of the MNIST dataset. I have attached the original paper, but you can also read recent blogs etc. to get an idea on how it works. You need to implement SMOTE yourself. The MNIST dataset is given. It has all digits. Just focus on 3 and 5.
